# Tweet Depression Detection


## Motivation ðŸ’¡
The Tweet Depression Detection project aims to create a machine learning model that can classify tweets as either "normal" or "depressive." As depression becomes an increasingly important topic in mental health, social media platforms such as Twitter provide a unique opportunity to study and potentially identify individuals at risk of depression ðŸ“ˆ. By analyzing large amounts of tweet data, I hope to develop a model that can accurately classify tweets and provide insights into how individuals express depressive symptoms on social media. ðŸ’­


## Dataset ðŸ“Š
For this project, I will be using two datasets: the Sentiment140 dataset and a dataset of depressive tweets scraped by Twint.

The Sentiment140 dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140 contains 1.6 million tweets. While this dataset is not specifically designed for detecting depression, I will use a subset of this dataset containing approximately 8000 to 10,000 randomly sampled tweets for our "normal" tweet class.

To create our "depressive" tweet class, we found a separate dataset of tweets that had been scraped by Twint using keywords related to depression https://github.com/eddieir/Depression_detection_using_Twitter_post/blob/master/depressive_tweets_processed.csv. This dataset contains approximately 4,000 tweets that have been labeled as depressive. ðŸ˜ž

## Data Processing ðŸ¤”

I will combine these two datasets to create a labeled dataset for training our machine learning model. By using these two datasets, I aim to create a model that can accurately distinguish between "normal" and "depressive" tweets, and potentially identify individuals who may be at risk of depression based on their social media activity. ðŸ’»
